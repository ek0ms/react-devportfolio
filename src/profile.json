    "I'm a full-stack developer based in the ever-historic city of Boston. I have a passion for web designâ€” with an affinity for user experience and front-end development. When I'm not in front of a computer screen, you can find me behind a ukulele, with my head buried in a Spanish textbook, or cruising through the streets on my longboard.",
